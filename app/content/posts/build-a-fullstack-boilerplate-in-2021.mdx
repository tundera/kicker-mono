Web apps have become increasingly complex as the React ecosystem has matured. Today, it's easier
than ever to integrate backend services into React applications using server-side rendering. One of
the more popular frameworks for simplifying a lot of boilerplate code that goes into this approach
is Next.js, which allows developers to easily choose how pages in an application should be rendered,
along with a bunch of other features that reduce the need for splitting work between frontend and
backend engineers.

Although Next.js provides a great starting point, as tooling has become more complex, a lot of
engineers are faced with the burden of integrating these tools into their applications which can
take days and sometimes weeks. In this post, we're going to explore the makings of a great
boilerplate that will curb a lot of the time spent on this setup.
