# Kicker Project

These are your official project documentation site. It's built with with
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using [Dokz](https://dokz.site/) and styled with
[Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

Here you can keep documentation for developers working in the codebase or instructions for consumers
of your product(s)/service(s). All your content here is written in MDX (`.mdx`) and simple Markdown
files (`.md`). You can even add a blog if you'd like to record changes you make to your codebase so
other stay in the loop. Learn more at the Dokz documentation site [here](https://dokz.site/docs).

Writing documentation is much easier when you have a template to start from. On this site you'll
find all the important info on Kicker and how to work efficiently in the monorepo. Instead of
creating a new site, it's recommended to overwrite these docs to get you moving a bit faster. The
default docs are all available in a GitHub repository [here]() and available to download via PDF
[here]().

## Monorepo Codebase

Kicker is an advanced codebase with a monorepo architecture. A monorepo is essentially a parent
project with centralized dependency management for multiple child projects. All code is managed from
a single source control repository that can trigger multiple deploys in CI/CD. This is advantageous
from a development and deployment standpoint, as many applications and APIs can consume common
dependencies from a single source as opposed to being duplicated across their respective projects.

To illustrate this design, imagine you have several Next.js apps that all require `next`, `react`
and `react-dom` as dependencies. You could manage all those projects separately in their own
repositories, but then you would need to install those packages in each your projects. This takes up
disk space, adds to install times, and can lead to versioning discrepancies between your
applications. Additonally, monorepos are perfect for scaling your platform and since your projects
can depend on one another. Seems like monorepos are a great option...but why aren't they more
common?

In the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, monorepos are notoriously difficult to build and can be
tricky to maintain when proper tooling is not available. For this reason alone, many find it easier
to and more productive to separate their projects despite the aformentioned tradeoffs. Luckily, you
can easily bypass most of these difficulties by applying the correct tooling to a monorepo.

Kicker does this for you, so you can benefit from all the perks of a monorepo architecture without
needing to worry about how well your codebase will scale.

## Tooling and Enhancements

This monorepo is built using [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/),
[Preconstruct](https://preconstruct.tools/), and [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/). These are standard
tools for the majority of monorepos focused on React, Node, and GraphQL (although not exclusive to
this ecosystem).

### Commands

Here is some code

```js
const x = 'kicker'
console.log('hello ' + x + ' world')
```

## Using the playground

You can use live react code to display react component with a preview

<Playground>
  <div style={{ width: 100, height: 100, background: 'lightblue' }}>hello everyone</div>
</Playground>
